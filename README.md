# SuperStore Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze trends within the SuperStore dataset and identify actionable insights to create better informed business decisions. The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final) which contains order information from 2014-2017 of a super store giant, which we will call SuperStore. The dataset includes order/shipping dates, customer ids/names/segments, location in the form of regions/states/cities/postal codes, the category/sub-category/product names, as well as the sales, quantity, discounts, and profits from each and every sale over the years. 
In this analysis, the differences between the regions or states that lead to differing profitabilities will be explored, while drawing actionable insights on how to increase revenue throughout the country. This analysis will also evaluate the profitability of items sold at the SuperStore to generate insights on how to proceed forward and bring enlightenment in the development of the next business plan.
